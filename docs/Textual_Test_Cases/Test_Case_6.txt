This test has a heavy dependency upon use_case_5 (MakeNewTopLevelComment).

Using a UI thread two new TopLevelComments, topLevel1 and topLevel2,  are created.
These comments are then pushed to the CommentController, and if we are w/o WebServiceController functionality,
then the CommentController will push topLevel1 and topLevel2 into the CommentArrayAdapter.
Otherwise topLevel1 and topLevel2 can be pushed to WebServiceController and retrieved from WebServiceController 
where it will then be pushed into CommentArrayAdapter.The ListView associated with CommentArrayAdapter is then updated.

To Verify the results:

 use ViewAsserts.assertOnScreen(ListView, CommentArrayAdapter.getView(topLevel1, null, null))
 use ViewAsserts.assertOnScreen(ListView, CommentArrayAdapter.getView(topLevel2, null, null))
 // review second parameter
