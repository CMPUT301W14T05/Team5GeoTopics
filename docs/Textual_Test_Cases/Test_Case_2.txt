Using a UI test thread, three Comments are created with different locations.
i.e., firstComment.Location != secondComment.Location != thirdComment.Location
In the same thread the comments are then loaded into the CommentArrayAdapter.
Code is written to initiate a Sort by Location with a location that is unique
among the locations of the Comments. 

To verify the results:
ensure that Comment_0.Distance <= Comment_1.Distance <= ... <= Comment_n.Distance

the _x subscript where x is an int refers to the Comment position in the array adapter.
