Using a UI thread, a TopLevelComment -- topLevel -- and a Reply -- reply -- are created. Ensure that the Favorites Cache is empty.
Both of these comments are added to the the Favorites Cache. Then the Favorites Cache is loaded into the CommentAdapter associated with the
ListView that is associated with the GeoTopicsActivity. This is done by selecting the view Favorites. The ListView is then updated. 

To Verify the results:
				//when the comments are added to the favorites cache
				assertTrue(cacheController.getFavorites().contains(adapter.getItem(0)));
				assertTrue(cacheController.getFavorites().contains(adapter.getItem(1)));
				//viewFavoritesBtn = (Button) activity.findViewById(ca.ualberta.cs.team5geotopics.R.id.viewFavorites);
				ViewAsserts.assertOnScreen(viewFavoritesBtn.getRootView(), viewFavoritesBtn); 
				//when the favorites cache is loaded
				ViewAsserts.assertOnScreen(listView, view); //view = adapter.getView(0, null, null);
				ViewAsserts.assertOnScreen(listView, view); //view = adapter.getView(1, null, null);
