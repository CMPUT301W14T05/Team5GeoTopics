Using a UI thread, a TopLevelComment -- topLevel -- is created. topLevel is then pushed to the CommentController, and if we are w/o WebServiceController functionality, 
then the CommentController will push topLevel into the CommentArrayAdapter.Otherwise topLevel can be pushed to WebServiceController and retrieved from WebServiceController 
where it will then be pushed into CommentArrayAdapter. The ListView associated with CommentArrayAdapter is then updated. topLevel is then selected to be viewed.
Then the comment text is edited, location is edited and picure is edited. The ListView associated with CommentArrayAdapter is then updated.

To Verify the results:
	ViewAsserts.assertOnScreen(listView, view); // use this when the ListView is updated 
																						  // view is adapter.getView(adapter.getPosition(topLevel), null, null); 

	ViewAsserts.assertOnScreen(view, editBtn); // use this to make sure edit btn is on screen
																						 // editBtn = (Button) activity.findViewById(ca.ualberta.cs.team5geotopics.R.id.editCommentBtn);	

	assertFalse(commentText_prime.equals(CommentText)) //commentText_prime is the new string derived from the TextView (comment text) portion of topLevel row in the adapter
	assertFalse(commentPic_prime.equals(CommentPic))   //commentPic_prime is the new bitmap derived from the ImageView portion of the topLevel row in the adapter
	assertFalse(commentLoc_prime.equals(CommentLoc))   //commentLoc_prime is the new location that is derived from the topLevel comment
