Using a UI thread, a TopLevelComment -- topLevel -- is created. topLevel is then pushed to the CommentController, and the topLevel
is pushed to the WebServiceController. Then the topLevel is pushed to the ElasticSearch WebService. These steps should be done without
explicit instruction. 

To Verify the results:
	assertTrue(ElasticSearch.has(topLevel)) // unsure how to implement
