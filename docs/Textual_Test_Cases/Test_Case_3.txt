Using a UI test thread, two Comments are created with different picture properties.
i.e., firstComment.hasPicture() == false && secondComment.hasPicture() == true
In the same thread the comments are then loaded into the CommentArrayAdapter.
Code is written to initiate a Sort by Picture.

To verify the results:
ensure that Comment_0.hasPicture() == true && Comment_1.hasPicture == false

the _x subscript where x is an int refers to the Comment position in the array adapter.
