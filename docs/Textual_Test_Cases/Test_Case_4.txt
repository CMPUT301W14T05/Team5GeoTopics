Scoring Option 1: sortCommentsByDate
  Comments will be sorted relative to how new they are.

  To test, create 3 new comments (A, B, C) in that order and then 
  insert them into a list in some other order. When sortCommentsByDate
  is called the list should be ordered in the reverse order they were 
  created (C, B, A).
  
Scoring Option 2: sortCommentsByFreshness
  Comments will be sorted by a weighted sort between proximity and newness

  To test, create 3 new comments that have a known end resulting sort
  insert them into the list in a different order and call sortCommentsByFreshness
  then compare to the expected sort.
