Not exactly sure how we will test this yet, as we have not clearly
laid out how we will be setting up said 'scoring system'. We may need
a few test cases for this as users will have to be able to select different
attributes to sort on.

The main flow of this test will be much like the other sorting tests found in 
this class. We will have to create a few dummy comments with different attributes
then we will have to test the different possible scoring systems on the dummy
comments. Since we what attributes make up the comments we will be able to 
predetermine the expected outcomes and will compare them to the actual outcomes
in order to test this.
