Using a UI thread, a TopLevelComment -- topLevel -- is created using "test author" as the author name.
topLevel is then pushed to the CommentController, and if we are w/o WebServiceController functionality, 
then the CommentController will push topLevel into the CommentArrayAdapter.
Otherwise topLevel can be pushed to WebServiceController and retrieved from WebServiceController 
where it will then be pushed into CommentArrayAdapter. The ListView associated with CommentArrayAdapter is then updated. 
topLevel is then selected to be viewed.

To verify results:
	assertTrue(adapter.getItem(adapter.getPosition(topLevel)).getAuthorName.equals("test author"));
