Using a UI thread, a TopLevelComment topLevel is created, and the picture member is non-null and 
containing a valid bitmap, let this bitmap be called bm. topLevel is then pushed to the CommentController,
and if we are w/o WebServiceController functionality, then the CommentController will push topLevel into 
the CommentArrayAdapter. Otherwise topLevel can be pushed to WebServiceController and retrieved from 
WebServiceController where it will then be pushed into CommentArrayAdapter.The ListView associated with 
CommentArrayAdapter is then updated. 

To Verify the results:

 ViewAsserts.assertOnScreen(CommentArrayAdapter.getView(topLevel, null, null),
													 (ImageView)ca.ualberta.cs.team5geotopics.GeoTopicsActivity.R.id.commentPicture)
AssertTrue(((ImageView)ca.ualberta.cs.team5geotopics.GeoTopicsActivity.R.id.commentPicture).getDrawable().equals(bm))
 // review second parameter
