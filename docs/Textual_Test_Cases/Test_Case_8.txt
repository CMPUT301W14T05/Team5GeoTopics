Using a UI thread, a TopLevelComment topLevel is created. topLevel is then pushed to the CommentController, and if we are w/o WebServiceController functionality,
then the CommentController will push topLevel into the CommentArrayAdapter.
Otherwise topLevel can be pushed to WebServiceController and retrieved from WebServiceController where it will then be pushed into CommentArrayAdapter.
The ListView associated with CommentArrayAdapter is then updated. From there the the comment will be viewed, and then a reply to topLevel will 
be created called replyLevel. Then we load the replies to topLevel into the CommentArrayAdapter and update the ListView.

To Verify the results:

 use ViewAsserts.assertOnScreen(ListView, CommentArrayAdapter.getView(replyLevel, null, null))
 // review second parameter 

 // same as Test_Case_7.txt
