Using a UI thread, a TopLevelComment -- topLevel -- is created using a location 
different from the defualt locale. topLevel is then pushed to the CommentController, 
and if we are w/o WebServiceController functionality, then the CommentController 
will push topLevel into the CommentArrayAdapter.Otherwise topLevel can be pushed to 
WebServiceController and retrieved from WebServiceController where it will then be 
pushed into CommentArrayAdapter. The ListView associated with CommentArrayAdapter 
is then updated. topLevel is then selected to be viewed. Then the comment text is edited, 
location is edited and picure is edited. The ListView associated with CommentArrayAdapter 
is then updated.

To Verify the results:
	assertFalse(comment.getLocation().equals(LocationManager.getCurrentLocation()))
 // where comment = CommentArrayAdapter.getItem(CommentArrayAdapter.getPosition(topLevel))
