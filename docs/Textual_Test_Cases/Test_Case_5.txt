Using a UI thread a new TopLevelComment, topLevel,  is created. Then topLevel is then pushed
to the CommentController, and if we are w/o WebServiceController functionality,
then the CommentController will push topLevel into the CommentArrayAdapter.
Otherwise topLevel can be pushed to WebServiceController and retrieved from WebServiceController where it will then be pushed into CommentArrayAdapter.
The ListView associated with CommentArrayAdapter is then updated.

To Verify the results:

 use ViewAsserts.assertOnScreen(ListView, CommentArrayAdapter.getView(TopLevelComment, null, null))
 // review second parameter
