Using a UI thread, a TopLevelComment -- topLevel -- is created. topLevel is then pushed to the CommentController, and the topLevel
is pushed to the WebServiceController. Then the topLevel is pushed to the ElasticSearch WebService. These steps should be done without
explicit instruction. The WebServiceController then pulls topLevel from the WebService, and pushes topLevel to CommentController which
then updates CommentListAdapter and this in turn updates the ListView associated with GeoTopicsActivity. Unsure of level of explicitness.

To Verify the results:
	ViewAsserts.assertOnScreen(listView, view); // use this when the ListView is updated 
																						  // view is adapter.getView(adapter.getPosition(topLevel), null, null);
