The GeoTopics uses a unique way to manually set the location; if you have Google Maps installed properly, it prompts
a virtual map and if not, it prompts for a manual longitude and latitude.

In order to use the Google Maps functionality please ensure these steps are done:

1. Clone and import our project into Eclipse.
2. Right click on "GeoTopicsActivity" -> Properties -> Android (on the left side) ensure google-play-services_lib is imported.
3. Go to Window -> Android SDK Manager and at the bottom, check and install "Google Play services"
4. Restart Eclipse.
5. Create a new emulator with the Google API rather than the normal Android API.

That should give you the virtual map functionality when you go to set/edit a location.
